'''
This python program is use to create process_cal class.
The process_cal class is a class that contain list of dictionary of events from ics file
This file use code from process_cal2.py to help with the methods.
Aside from the constructor this file has 1 main method which is get_events_for_day every other
method is a helper to either the constructor or get_events_for_day
